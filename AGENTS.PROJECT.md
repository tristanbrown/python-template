# Project-Specific Agent Instructions

Purpose of this file
- Add rules that apply only to this repository (coding style, structure, naming, task scope, etc.).

Precedence
- When rules here conflict with `.agents/AGENTS.GLOBAL.md`, these project rules take precedence by default.

Guidelines
- Keep instructions concise and actionable.
- Rules should focus on code within this repo.
- You may include short, non-binding context (purpose, goals, scope) to orient the agent.
- State overrides explicitly when helpful for clarity, though project rules already take precedence.

Implementation note
- Keep the sections above. Add or modify the sections below under "Project Rules".
- Replace the TODOs with concrete, concise rules for this repo.
